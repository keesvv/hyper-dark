# What's different?
I've modified some colors from which I thought were a little too dark. Some colors are now more 'alive', but I left the background color original.

# Installation
1. Type the following command in your Terminal emulator:
2. Open the file `.hyper.js` in your favorite text editor or access Hyper's preferences by pressing `Cmd + ,`.
3. Modify the `plugins` array to include `hyper-solarized`:  

  ```js
  plugins: [  
    'hyper-solarized'  
  ],
  ```

4. Reload Hyper by pressing `Cmd + Shft + R` If this doesn't work, try closing and reopening Hyper.
