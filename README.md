# What's different?
I've modified some colors from which I thought were a little too dark. Some colors are now more 'alive', but I left the background color original.

# Installation
1. Open the file `~/.hyper.js` in your favorite text editor or access Hyper's preferences by pressing `Cmd + ,`.
2. Modify the `plugins` array to add `hyper-dark`:  

  ```js
  plugins: [  
    'hyper-dark'  
  ],
  ```

3. Reload Hyper by pressing `Cmd + Shift + R`. If this doesn't work, try closing and reopening Hyper.
